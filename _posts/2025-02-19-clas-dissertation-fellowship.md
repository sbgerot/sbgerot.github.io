I’m excited to share that I was selected as one of ten recipients of the CLAS Dissertation Writing Fellowship for Summer and Fall 2025, awarded by the University of Iowa’s College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. This fellowship provides dedicated time and support for completing my dissertation.

Many thanks to everyone who has supported me throughout this journey!
