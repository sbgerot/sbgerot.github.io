I am honored to have received the Post-Comprehensive Research Fellowship from the University of Iowa’s Graduate College. This competitive fellowship provides support for doctoral students to focus on their research following the successful completion of comprehensive examinations.

The fellowship enables me to dedicate time to developing my dissertation, which investigates the role of habitual political news consumption in shaping public opinion, misinformation, and affective polarization in the United States.
