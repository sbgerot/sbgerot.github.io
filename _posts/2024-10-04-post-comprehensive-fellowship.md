I am honored to have received the Post-Comprehensive Research Fellowship from the University of Iowa’s Graduate College. This competitive fellowship provides support for doctoral students to focus on their research following the successful completion of comprehensive examinations.

The fellowship supports my dissertation focusing on how everyday political media habits influence public opinion, democratic engagement, and mental well-being.
