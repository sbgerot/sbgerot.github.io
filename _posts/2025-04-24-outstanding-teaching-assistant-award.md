I’m excited to share that I’ve been selected as one of the recipients of the [Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award](https://cot.org.uiowa.edu/teaching-awards/outstanding-teaching-assistant-awards) from the University of Iowa’s Council on Teaching. I’m grateful to everyone who’s supported me, especially my students, whose engagement makes teaching such a fulfilling experience.

Looking forward to the awards reception on April 29, 2025!
