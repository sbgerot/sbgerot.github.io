I recently presented my paper, **“News, on Repeat: Examining the Relationship Between Habitual Media Use and Affective Polarization”**, at the **Midwest Political Science Association (MPSA) Conference** in Chicago.

This research investigates how entrenched political media habits contribute to affective polarization, amplifying partisan divides in the U.S. The conference provided a great opportunity to share my work and engage with scholars working on media, partisanship, and political behavior.

Preliminary findings show that stronger habitual political news consumption is associated with greater emotional distance from political opponents, suggesting that everyday media habits may reinforce affective polarization.

Thank you to everyone who attended and offered valuable feedback as I continue to develop this research further.
