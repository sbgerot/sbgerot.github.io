## About
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of Iowa, where I study political media habits, public opinion, and political behavior in the United States. My research explores how everyday news consumption influences key aspects of democratic engagement, including political knowledge, belief in misinformation, affective polarization, and emotional well-being.

I am currently completing my dissertation on the political and psychological consequences of habitual political news consumption, as one of ten recipients of the CLAS Dissertation Writing Fellowship. My work introduces a new approach to measuring media habits, focusing not only on how often individuals consume political news but also on the extent to which this engagement occurs automatically, as part of daily routines. I use a mix of survey-based methods, text analysis, and digital diary studies to examine how media habits shape public attitudes and behaviors in an increasingly polarized media environment.

My academic interests include:  
American Politics  
Public Opinion and Political Behavior  
Political Communication  
Political Psychology
