Welcome, and thank you for visiting my website.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of Iowa, where I study political media habits, public opinion, and political behavior in the United States. My research examines how habitual news consumption shapes key aspects of democratic engagement, including beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors.

Currently, I am one of ten recipients of the CLAS Dissertation Writing Fellowship, awarded to support the completion of my dissertation, which investigates the political and psychological consequences of habitual political news consumption. My work introduces a new approach to measuring media habits, focusing not only on how often individuals consume political news but also on the extent to which this engagement occurs automatically, as part of daily routines.

Using original survey data, I explore how these habits influence political knowledge, belief in misinformation, affective polarization, and emotional well-being. My research draws from political psychology, media studies, and public opinion, with an emphasis on survey-based methods. I also incorporate digital diary studies to capture the day-to-day patterns of political news consumption and their relationship to emotional well-being and democratic attitudesâ€”offering additional insight into how habitual media use unfolds in everyday life.

In addition to survey-based research, I apply text analysis and machine learning techniques to explore patterns in political communication and media environments, contributing to a deeper understanding of how media ecosystems shape public opinion and political behavior.
