# Welcome to My Website!

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at the University of Iowa. My research examines the intersection of political media habits, public opinion, and democratic engagement in the United States.

Here you'll find updates about my research, ongoing projects, and academic work.

Additional updates and content will be added in the near future. Please feel free to explore and reach out with any inquiries.
