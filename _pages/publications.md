# Research Overview

I am a scholar of American Politics and Political Communication whose research examines how habitual political news consumption influences citizens’ attitudes, the accuracy of their beliefs, and their emotional well-being. Drawing on surveys, typological analyses, time-series modeling, and diary-based methods, I develop a dual-dimensional framework that captures both the frequency and automaticity of political news engagement. This approach shifts the focus from what people consume to how they consume it, helping explain why individuals with similar exposure to political news often arrive at very different beliefs, levels of trust, or emotional responses. My work contributes to urgent conversations on misinformation and affective polarization by offering a behavioral perspective on how deeply embedded media routines shape political cognition and affect in a fragmented information environment. It also underscores the growing emotional toll of contemporary political life—and what this means for citizens’ capacity and willingness to participate in democracy. To advance this agenda, I designed a 15-day digital diary study to track daily news consumption and its connections to well-being, which received national support through the APSA/NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant (DDRIG) and is now in the process of being launched as a national pilot in late Fall 2025.
