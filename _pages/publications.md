## Research Overview

My research focuses on the role of habitual political news consumption in shaping democratic attitudes and behaviors in the United States. I explore how everyday patterns of media use influence public opinion, belief in misinformation, affective polarization, and mental well-being.

A key contribution of my work is the adaptation of the Self-Reported Habitual Index (SRHI) to measure political news habits. This dual-measure approach captures not only the frequency of political news consumption but also its automaticityâ€”how often people engage with political media as part of their routine, without conscious intention.

### Dissertation Project: *The Power of Routine*

My dissertation, *The Power of Routine: How News Consumption Habits Shape Political Attitudes and Well-Being in the U.S.*, introduces a novel way of understanding media habits beyond mere frequency. Using original survey data and a 15-day digital diary study, I investigate:

- How habitual media use affects political knowledge and misinformation beliefs.
- The relationship between media habits and affective polarization, particularly out-group hostility.
- The emotional toll of habitual news exposure, especially in relation to stress and anxiety during politically charged times.

### Current Research Areas

- **Political Media Habits:** Measurement and impact of frequency vs. automaticity.
- **Misinformation & Knowledge:** How habits relate to factual political knowledge and susceptibility to false claims.
- **Polarization:** Media's role in reinforcing partisan divides and social distance.
- **Mental Well-Being:** Effects of continuous news exposure on emotional health.

More updates on publications and projects will be added soon.
