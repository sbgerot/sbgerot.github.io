# Research Overview

My research focuses on the role of habitual political news consumption in shaping democratic attitudes and behaviors in the United States. I examine how routine patterns of media engagement influence public opinion, susceptibility to misinformation, affective polarization, and mental well-being.

A key contribution of my work is the adaptation of the Self-Reported Habitual Index (SRHI) to measure political news habits. This dual-measure approach captures both the frequency of news consumption and its automaticity—how often people engage with political media as part of their daily routine, often without deliberate intention. I employ a range of methods, including original and panel survey data, digital diary studies that track real-time media use and emotional responses, and text analysis combined with machine learning to explore the content and dynamics of political communication.

My dissertation, The Power of Routine: _How News Consumption Habits Shape Political Attitudes and Well-Being in the U.S._, offers a novel perspective on media behavior beyond mere frequency. Using original survey data and a 15-day digital diary study, I investigate how habitual media use affects political knowledge and misinformation belief, contributes to affective polarization—emotional hostility toward political opponents that deepens partisan divides—and impacts stress, anxiety, and overall well-being during politically charged times.
