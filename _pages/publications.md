# Research Overview

My research focuses on the role of habitual political news consumption in shaping democratic attitudes and behaviors in the United States. I explore how everyday patterns of media use influence public opinion, belief in misinformation, affective polarization, and mental well-being.

A key contribution of my work is the adaptation of the Self-Reported Habitual Index (SRHI) to measure political news habits. This dual-measure approach captures not only the frequency of political news consumption but also its automaticity—how often people engage with political media as part of their routine, without conscious intention. I use a combination of methodologies in my research, including survey-based methods with original and panel data, digital diary studies that capture real-time patterns of media use and emotional responses, and text analysis alongside machine learning techniques to explore the content and dynamics of political communication.

<p>My dissertation, <em>The Power of Routine: How News Consumption Habits Shape Political Attitudes and Well-Being in the U.S.</em>, introduces a novel way of understanding media habits beyond mere frequency. Using original survey data and a 15-day digital diary study, I investigate:</p>

  <p>– How habitual media use affects political knowledge and belief in misinformation</p>
  <p>– The relationship between media habits and affective polarization—defined as growing emotional hostility toward political opponents, which intensifies partisan divides and reduces willingness to engage across party lines</p>
  <p>– The emotional toll of habitual news exposure, particularly its links to stress, anxiety, and diminished well-being during politically charged times</p>
