# Research Overview

My research focuses on the role of habitual political news consumption in shaping democratic attitudes and behaviors in the United States. I explore how everyday patterns of media use influence public opinion, belief in misinformation, affective polarization, and mental well-being.

A key contribution of my work is the adaptation of the Self-Reported Habitual Index (SRHI) to measure political news habits. This dual-measure approach captures not only the frequency of political news consumption but also its automaticity—how often people engage with political media as part of their routine, without conscious intention. I use a combination of methodologies in my research, including survey-based methods with original and panel data, digital diary studies that capture real-time patterns of media use and emotional responses, and text analysis alongside machine learning techniques to explore the content and dynamics of political communication.

My dissertation, _The Power of Routine: How News Consumption Habits Shape Political Attitudes and Well-Being in the U.S._, introduces a novel way of understanding media habits beyond mere frequency. Using original survey data and a 15-day digital diary study, I investigate how habitual media use affects political knowledge and belief in misinformation, how media habits contribute to affective polarization—defined as growing emotional hostility toward political opponents, which intensifies partisan divides and reduces willingness to engage across party lines—and the emotional toll of habitual news exposure, particularly its links to stress, anxiety, and diminished well-being during politically charged times.
